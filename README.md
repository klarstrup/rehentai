# rehentai
React ExHentai/E-Hentai client via GraphQL facade

## requirements

you need node 8+ and yarn 0.24+

## install

```sh
yarn install
```

## config

For now you'll have to have an E-Hentai forums account - rename/copy the `.env.example` file in the root of this project to `.env` and fill in your E-Hentai forums credentials.

Maybe I care enough to implement a logged-out mode eventually

## start

```sh
yarn start
```
